/**
 * Data specific to the art assets used here. If the art assets change, you will need to update this class.
 * This tracks not just the numbers associated with unnamed art assets, but also which tiles are rotations of other
 * tiles for when the map rotates, which path tiles can connect to which other path tiles, and so on. The
 * {@link #realignPaths(LocalMap)} method takes a LocalMap and updates the rotations of paths in it so they all line up
 * coherently. There are also some numbers and names for entities, but the code here mostly doesn't use them because the
 * specific assets were already sorted how we needed them -- entities 0-3 are playable humans, and 4-7 are enemy orcs.
 * <br>
 * This has constants to provide names for the numbered tiles and entities in the {@code isometric-trpg.atlas}, a map
 * {@link #TILES} that allows looking up tile constants with a String name, and a map {@link #ENTITIES} that allows
 * looking up entity constants (for use in the four Animation Arrays). Importantly, this also stores data for how to
 * render some tiles when they rotate, to prevent paths from becoming disconnected when the map rotates.
 * <br>
 * In the project as it is here, all tiles have already been stored in a single atlas on one page, sharing that page
 * with a bitmap font and UI widgets. Using just one atlas page helps performance quite a bit, because it avoids any
 * "texture swaps" that SpriteBatch would otherwise need to do when a different page or Texture was needed. If you have
 * your own assets, packing them into an atlas is strongly recommended! For this project, the very convenient
 * <a href="https://github.com/crashinvaders/gdx-texture-packer-gui">CrashInvaders' GDX Texture Packer GUI</a> was used,
 * but you can also use the texture packer supplied in libGDX as part of its gdx-tools, or launch that packer as part of
 * your Gradle configuration so your atlas is always up-to-date. Packing an atlas does best with individual tiny images
 * with the appropriate names you want to look up, OR some common prefix followed by an underscore {@code _} and a
 * number to make (usually) an animation frame with that index. The numbers can be finicky; make sure to start at 0 and
 * not include any initial 0 otherwise ("0", "1", "2", is good, but "00", "01", "02" is not).
 * <br>
 * If you use a different set of assets, you will not need the values in this file, but you could use it as an example
 * for how to make your own. You could also just use int indices throughout your project, or name the regions in your
 * atlas according to your own rules. Other free assets may have names you can apply to the atlas instead of numbers,
 * but this tends to be rather rare in practice. It isn't isometric normally, but
 * <a href="https://github.com/tommyettinger/DawnLikeAtlas">DawnLikeAtlas</a> is a large, free set of assets that has
 * names attached to each file in a libGDX atlas. Its entities are about the same size as the ones used here, though
 * they don't have facing and have just two animation frames. The DawnLike creatures could be used instead of the assets
 * here, though, since there are many more of them. Ideally, you would repack any extra assets into an atlas like the
 * one this uses (with a font and any terrain you want). You can either fetch the raw assets from the independent repo
 * used for in-progress parts of this project,
 * <a href="https://github.com/tommyettinger/IsometricVoxelDemo">which is here</a>, or unpack the atlas used here (the
 * GUI linked above has an "Unpack atlas" option in the top bar), then get the parts you want from any atlases you want
 * to mix in, and pack those all together into one central atlas. Using just one folder works well.
 * <br>
 * There are several terms used in the tile names for grouping logically.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Tiles that are meant to be approximately half as tall as a unit voxel contain "HALF" in the constant name.</li>
 * <li>Tiles that are meant to just barely cover the top of a unit voxel contain "BASE" in their constant name.</li>
 * <li>Tiles that are meant to flow over the top of a surface of their height contain "COVER" in their constant name.</li>
 * <li>Cover tiles have a suffix containing "F", "G", and/or "H" depending on whether they cover the f or g side edges,
 * or the h face on top.</li>
 * <li>Tiles that have a path on them that changes depending on view angle have "PATH" in their constant name. Path tiles
 * have a suffix containing "F", "G", "T", and/or "R" depending on which faces are connected to the path, where fgtr are
 * the recommended keys on a QWERTY keyboard to move in those directions, or on a map of Europe, the locations of
 * France, Germany, Tallinn (in Estonia), and Reykjavík (in Iceland) relative to Amsterdam in the center.</li>
 * <li>Tiles that are not meant to be stackable have "DECO" in their constant name.</li>
 * <li>Bed tiles have "BED" in the name and a suffix indicating the faces that touch the footboard and headboard.</li>
 * <li>Some tiles have "CAP" in their name to indicate that only the top face is a given type, and the rest of the unit
 * voxel is simply dirt.</li>
 * </ul>
